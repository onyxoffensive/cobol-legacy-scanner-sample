🏛️ COBOL Catalyst (CC)
by Onyx Offensive | Legacy Defense Division 🌎
"Modern banking survives on 50-year-old logic. We ensure it thrives."

The COBOL Catalyst (CC) is an offensive security engine designed to identify architectural decay and vulnerability vectors within legacy mainframe infrastructure. While modern security stacks stop at the cloud, Onyx Offensive goes to the bedrock.

⚡ The Mastercard Paradox
Tactical Audit: $25,000

Continuous Shield: $150,000

Sovereign Enterprise: $500,000

A systemic ransomware breach on unpatched COBOL? Priceless.

🔍 Capability Overview
The CC engine simulates adversarial targeting to detect high-impact vulnerabilities in legacy logic:

Injection Vectors: Identifying unsanitized console input routed to dynamic SQL.

Data Sovereignty: Locating unmasked PII (SSN/Account Nos) in standard output logs.

Auth Bypass: Detecting hardcoded administrative credentials and "backdoor" logic.

Protocol Decay: Mapping insecure communication routines (FTP/Cleartext).

🛠️ Engagement Roadmap
Our methodology transitions legacy systems from "Vulnerable" to "Sovereign" through a rigorous 4-stage process:

Ingestion: Secure mirroring of legacy logic blocks.

Offensive Analysis: Pattern matching against known mainframe exploit vectors.

Liability Quantification: Estimating regulatory (PCI-DSS/GDPR) exposure.

Remediation: Engineering custom logic patches to harden the core.
